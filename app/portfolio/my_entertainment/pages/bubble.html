<h1>Bubble Or Bust</h1>
  	<div id="story">
  		<p>  Bubble or Bust begins with a small child who decides to grab some bubble solution and a
  	    	wand and play outside in a meadow during a beautiful day. The child dips a wand in the fluid
  	    	and blows a variety of bubbles. The child becomes fixated on one in particular. Being a young
  	    	mind with a plethora of creativity, the child imagines the bubble floating through different
  	    	obstacles and terrain. The world suddenly changes as the player is transported to the world the
  	    	child has created with control over the bubble.<br>
  	      	Following the bubble through a clear blue sky reminds the child of their last summer
  	    	vacation at the beach. Unfortunately, they live too far inland to visit and are forced to only have
  	    	fun at the beach in their memories. The child is used to forests and mountains, colder terrain, but
  	    	wonders what the rest of the world is like. Young curiosity, a reason the child carries around
      		pictures of varying dry lands and a hand drawn image of the earth itself in outer space.</p>
  	  	<p><br>
  	      	As the bubble progresses through each world, the worlds change as the child’s
  	    	imagination grows and begins to think of new places to visit or explore. This makes the
  	    	environment more challenging as well as with the addition of enemies along the way. The player
  	    	must avoid all obstacles and enemies in order to fulfill the child’s imagination and keep the
     		bubble safe.</p>

    <tr>
      <td id="control">
      	<p>Players control the bubble’s movement using swipe gestures anywhere on the screen. This
			gesture resembles the act of blowing at a bubble. Swiping happens when the player drags a
			finger across the screen or clicks and drags with a mouse in any direction. The direction of the
			swipe determines where the bubble goes. The size of the force applied to the bubble depends on
			the speed of the swipe gesture. The faster the player completes the gesture, the farther the bubble
			goes. The player can make the bubble jump by quickly swiping upwards, which is necessary to
			avoid gaps and obstacles, as well as both enemies and their projectiles.</p>
	  </td>
      <td id="fight">
      	<p>Clicking and releasing the left mouse button or tapping the screen causes the bubble to shoot
			smaller bubble projectiles. A single tap or click fires one bubble projectile that originates from
			the player’s current position and moves towards the point where the player tapped or clicked. All
			projectiles move at a constant speed on a linear trajectory. When a bubble projectile hits a wall 		            or any other obstacle, it pops and disappears. When it hits an enemy, it also deals physical 	            damage. Different enemies require different numbers of hits to be defeated.</p>
	  </td>
      <td id="size">
      	<p>The player’s bubble can also transform into different sizes. It can grow or shrink five times its
			initial size. The bubble’s size represents the game character’s health.</p>
		<h4>Shrinking</h4>
		<p>The bubble can take damage from enemy attacks. If an enemy or projectile hits the player, the
			bubble will shrink. Stronger enemies or hazards can pop the bubble or kill it instantly.
			Its size can also be altered by environmental factors such as exposure to extreme hot
			temperatures. This heat causes the bubble to continuously shrink at a very fast rate. Every twenty
			seconds, the bubble decreases in size by one point.
			Players can make the bubble shrink by clicking or tapping on it. Firing three projectiles also
			reduces its size by one point.</p>
		<h4>Growing</h4>
		<p>When defeated, enemies dissolve into small bubbles, which the player can absorb to grow in
			size. Players need to absorb three bubbles in order to increase the bubble’s size by one point.
			These small bubbles can also be found scattered around the levels. The bubble can grow from
			absorbing water, clouds, and puddles of bubble solution.</p>
		<h4>Absorbing Enemies</h4>
		<p>Players can absorb enemies with the bubble by running over them only if its size is larger than
			the size of the enemy. If the bubble is smaller than the enemy, it will pop upon contact. Absorbed
			enemies can be used to press down pressure pads, cover hazardous environments, and block air
			currents. They can also be used as a projectile to stun other enemies. The bigger the enemy the
			player absorbs, the longer the stun lasts. Using this mechanic is necessary to solve a variety of
			puzzles to advance in the game.</p>
