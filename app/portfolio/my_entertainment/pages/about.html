		<p> I, Nicole Francisco, have lived in Florida for about 8 years after serving some time in the Navy.  I <br> graduated Magna Cum Laude from Seminole State College with an Associates in Arts Degree.  I am currently <br> attending the University of Central Florida in order to obtain a Bachelors in Game Design.  When searching for work I <br> desire a career in a fair-minded, goal oriented business with a strong emphasis on teamwork.</p>
        <br>
		<p>I am a mother of 3 children, 2 boys, 1 girl, and have been happily married for 2 years. Each <br> moment of my marraige and time with my kids have been the best times. In my spare time I love to watch <br> movies, read, play games, write, but most of all I love spending time with my family.</p>
